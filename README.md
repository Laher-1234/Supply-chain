# Supply-chain
Problem Statement :
                   Build a blockchain-powered supply chain management system that tracks a product through its entire lifecycle, from manufacturing to delivery. Each interaction or movement in the supply chain                          should be immutably recorded on the blockchain for transparency and accountability.
